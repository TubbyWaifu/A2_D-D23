            <p>
                Dungeons & Dragons over the last year has been under development to reach its next major edition. No
                longer are the days of numbered editions such as its previous 5th edition. D&D is getting a massive game
                overhaul that will affect players for the foreseeable future.

            <p>
                Earlier this year, the official D&D company “Wizards of the Coast” tried to covertly release a new
                official gaming license. This license would have impacted the entire D&D community for objectively the
                worse and made the game a legal nightmare. Executive staff was responsible for the change and caused a
                PR disaster and war they had no idea would start.
