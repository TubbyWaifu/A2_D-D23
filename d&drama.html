            D&D has always been an open-sourced IP with some exceptions. Creators from anywhere in the world have been
            able to create their own adaptations of D&D and monetize said products. There has been a relative give and
            take in this regard where users can create with the D&D IP, and Wizards of the Coast (WOTC) can take from
            them what works with hopefully some credit.<br><br>

            However, this almost changed over night when WOTC subtlety adapted a new official game license (OGL). This
            OGL would have made it so creators would owe license back to WOTC for their D&D adapted content and creators
            would no longer be able to profit of their work. WOTC top executives felt that this was necessary as to
            capitalize on the money that other creators were getting from their IP. Needless to say, once the larger D&D
            community found out, there was massive out cry and spread awareness of this topic. Creators and news media
            alike took to social media to talk about this topic as this new OGL would cripple the fan base and send D&D
            into the dark ages.<br><br>

            WOTC was met with one of the biggest community backlashes ever and had a PR nightmare trying to deal with
            this decision. WOTC owes most of D&Ds resurgence in the mainstream to creators who were creating their own
            content and fans were not going to let them forget it. WOTC would not be where it is today with out some of
            the popular communities elevating D&D to its new status; fans felt that this was a massive betrayal.<br><br>

            After some large discussions WOTC disbanded this new OGL and apologized to the fans. It is true that WOTC
            may not be making as much money they should from D&D. Be this as it may, fans will make sure that their
            money hungry parent company Hasbro will not destroy what many hold dear to the heart. WOTC has been working
            with fans closely for the new One D&D. Which is where the franchise should remain, a collaborative IP
            between company and fans where something truly amazing can get created.<br><br>
