        <h2>One D&D</h2>
        <p>
            Dungeons & Dragons was created by designers Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson in 1974 and has undergone 5 editions
            since publication. Each edition building off the last and adapting with time. Each edition has had different
            over all changes to the game, some more positive changes and some more negative. The goal of every edition
            being to make D&D a better game than when it started. However, from D&Ds inception there have been long
            standing bias and racist notions that have plagued the game to the modern day. This is why for D&Ds newest
            edition there have been not only game mechanic changes, but progressive changes to address the deep-rooted
            controversies as well.<br><br>

            Wizards of the Coast announced earlier this year that D&D will be going through its next edition change in
            2024, code named: “One D&D”. They announced that not only would D&D not be going from 5th - 6th edition, but
            rather it would be generalized from here on out as one D&D. This comprehensive change would make it so D&D
            could be changed and adapt more rapidly at any time rather than wait for a whole new edition. New beta
            tested content could be implemented quicker with this new format as well. Over 2023 beta testing is underway
            to closely gauge changes and to implement what works with the core audience in One D&D. However, there is
            more than just progressive and generalized changes, there is also a platform and digital change happening as
            well.<br><br>

            D&D Beyond is a digital online platform for almost all licensed D&D content. This platform allows everything
            from creating character sheets to book campaign adventures. With One D&D, Wizards of the Coast is adapting
            D&D Beyond into its official digitized platform as an official resource (D&D Beyond was a separate IP but
            was acquired in 2022). Lastly, One D&D is looking to incorporate all sorts of new digital tools into their
            platform to enhance the over all experience should users choose to opt into their services.<br><br>

            One D&D is promising to be a positive overhaul to the game. With addressing the controversies, opening D&D
            to rapid responsive changes, and incorporating D&D Beyond/New tech D&D is on track to become better and more
            accessible than ever before.<br><br>
